# Contributing to smtp_to_telegram

I created this program to solve my specific need of receiving important
alerts on my phone quickly in a convenient application.

This program is feature-complete to me at the moment, and I don't need
any help or anything else.

Please respect my right to decline and ignore any suggestions or patches
for new features, which I might not want to maintain.

That said, there's a very low chance I'm going to accept your patch
if you do one. I'm sorry if that sounds arrogant, but I'm not willing
to spend extra time on this project.

Feel free to fork this project and adapt it for your needs. The program
is quite simple so I believe it will be easy for you. Just keep in
mind that you have to comply with the MIT License.
